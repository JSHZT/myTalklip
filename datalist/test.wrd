i am the ultimate power
i'm with mark twain lies
and i'm warning you
it's the internet
join me tomorrow
i feel rather embarrassed
heston is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
if we don't like it
probably in the world
a purification ceremony
and people living
it's almost an old person
it's about the dead
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquarians
i'm really looking forward to this
and this might be
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
you are out of it
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheat and steal from one another to get themselves a decent meal
in this case a flower
mr trump takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transition
the president elect has met with president obama
thank you very much
you've really made my day
and we have today
everywhere you look
and they don't make big money
earlier this month
it was brilliant
what have you learned
there's a fair chance you will be
about 2 million
and inflammatory photograph
in all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
our continued pressure
better street lighting can help
you have a problem with it
to allow bad surveillance to wither on the vine
i have nothing to hide
to the average person
inflammatory or terrible images
the next generation
if you don't like the slogan
when it comes to the issue of equal marriage
we have to look at how saudi arabia
in terms of britain
there aren't any biscuits in that barrel
when my father died
that would just make things worse
for the next two minutes
i didn't mean you
that i'll be ok
but i promise you
have you got it
you better stay well away from me
and went on the ordinary wing
and it's the one that
and you know that
on international women's day
that was beautiful
the duke of gloucester
that's very good
go to the press
learning the ropes
we'll give it a try
as a result of smoking
but you don't need to worry
the father died five years ago
the experts don't know what caused it
but another striking union
it's higher than before
this is all you
i do miss it a little bit
it seemed to be
the perfect family
the perfect house
you're wasting your time
including a baby
it's a terrible idea
what did you put in the mulled wine
i do nothing wrong
which upset some of our female residents
whatever it was
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
when i see that
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
this is very similar
and i wouldn't be surprised
or have they encountered problems
talk about smart
i've been waxed
we have to pay for that
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
to be a successful entrepreneur
you really feel a part of it
it certainly won't be
time has passed
i'm right in saying that
i think something drastic needs to be done
we don't want to spend more than
who's very much into family history
so let's go back and find out
you have to hold your nerve
i'm very impressed
what do you know about it
that's why i'm losing my voice
of course it will
it might be bonfire night
today's contestants are
pleased with himself
let's just calm down
which is only 10 minutes away
on the face of it
a great place for him to be
it's a multicultural
it can be quite expensive
with one of the rooms upstairs
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to do
this is a sweet
some issues with potential damp
before we all get too excited about that prospect
much more driven
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
i do know what it means
i want to talk about daddy too
when i found out
but it's not all bad news
after all i've been through
i shouldn't say those things
with climate change
that's a big attraction
as long as you're calm
free range good
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caged eggs
to make it work
is it all good news
here on the day
i hasten to add
not for subject matter
this is extremely rare and valuable
as well as the green man
there's plenty to indulge in
that is a sold sound
during the summer months
and you know what this means
louise and kevin
to speed things up
to see these animals
but don't worry
we have the delectable neil jones
thanks for watching
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
asking for permission
very fine indeed
and things like that
the day just got weirder and weirder
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
it's practically a vegetarian
that's why i get up in the morning
how does the plant attract the bat
back to the history books
this is the best bat hotel in town
the bat benefits
in other words made the base
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
we would love to see you
and i went to the museum in islington
let's put those valuations to the test
he made the superstructure
but i thought it was a bit depressing
would you be happy
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
to say to the king
when he was staying at the palace
this is south well
it really was that bad
it's part of the national gardens scheme
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goes
get them into the garden
so you know who he really is
you must have a personal key
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
i've been involved with the military
killing him and five friends
as we approach remembrance sunday
the armed forces
when it comes to publicity
flowers and even vegetables
for something completely different
so to do ballroom
if you've got a question for either of them
before we bring on our next contender
and it's all about the context
and from what i've heard
and i guess that's what's happening here
and the next day
and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
i would like to help
i need to close the restaurant
all in the glare of the spotlight
two minutes on general knowledge
get down to your local one
some got what they want
sort of second half of october
something like a garden compost
starting with the compost
well into november
when there isn't much else in the garden
it's not all about size
we can just about get away with it now
and if you want wonderful
that makes a grand total of six
in the form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
in a modern house
you want me to be happy
it's on our cable package
when we see him
without the dialogue
what their aspirations are
i can't believe it
but before that
and getting rid of it
put it that way
costing nearly 1 million
and it was built totally by public subscription
very heavily taxed
and the scottish customers to buy
goes out the other
we don't clip it for the money
he doesn't own me
it's not the middle ages
the first muslim woman to serve as a cabinet minister
when my husband and i are not around
it may take some time
thanks for watching
it might be conceptual
it's like looking at art
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
they love architecture
rightly or wrongly
it's not a massive sum of money
check the details on our website
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
our journey isn't over yet
done and dusted
that was fast and furious
he's japanese made
that's not an ancient roman mask
having said that
which a lot of them were
on the same proportion
even christmas day
i'm on the case
thanks for watching
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
but towards the end
but it was so disconcertingly calm in the studio
he has not held back anything
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
for the audience at home
the rise of may
that was within budget
it's here to stay
i had a great time
that's the best kind of teaching
every single person
he made a move on me
we've not discussed it
but for all that
leave that to me
today almost 50
the government looks set to win
stocks and shares
we like to reminisce
for that reason
but i like to see it
thanks for watching
who doesn't have vision
all of the brain is combining all the different senses
so rather than just relying on this information
it's become so fragmented
thanks for watching
and that's really well done
travel three miles further west and you do get more for your money
fabulous project for them
and turning upstairs into an open plan area is definitely the way to go
will it be above par
that's an option
that's very bad news
it takes hard work
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
the work was hard
or whatever it was
the operation would go ahead
not part of our glory
and here on top of the eagle tower
for the first time
which is now in syria
according to legend
in the first year alone
you don't deserve my grace
it was a blank canvas
tearing it to the ground
formally acknowledged his title as the prince of wales
one northern welsh ruler
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
there was a portcullis
he ordered them back inside
taking it all in
as she lay dying
according to legend
taking no chances
i don't think so
the guilt would go
but he wouldn't listen
run for cover if you can
was it your choice
welcome to the tower
they are under a lot of stress
and after reaching out to him on the show
with that in mind
it's actually a salsa
as i was saying
it was full of content
you are dynamic
thousands of pounds
which the norwegian government was supporting
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
i probably would
with people without creating
as you may know
with other people
this came from the big
and the initials stand for the international marxist group
that's really sad
going under the hammer right now
it didn't survive
you have to go and buy biscuits
you're wasting your time
they all came and went
as long as they see the spark of success
with their database
get a new loyal customer and debenhams
over the last 12 years
time now for our next guest
let's take a look behind the scenes at how it all came
i pay the money
over the course of his life
see how much it comes to
when it's finished
tickets for the match
he was so popular
these are my words
don't forget me
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
that's the message from independent economists after the chancellor's autumn statement
with my blessing
that was some time ago
in the long term
let's go inside
most of the recovered pieces were lost
very soon after taking off
i'm absolutely in love with this
anything can happen
that was exciting
i don't think so
that was going to be my next assumption
thanks for watching
because it was offices
we will own it together
i would market that
or properties should i say
it will be a great investment
ground floor flat
very close by the university
pretty on the outside
thanks for watching
that's what they do
played by jim broadbent
i hadn't thought that
in all seriousness
every two weeks
that would be fantastic
we did a different version of things and then
so what did you do before
and then turned to me and said
and she was being interviewed by the american journalists
but you have to go
they will not do
the man who cares about animals
child of the millennium
two appointments later
i'm struggling with that one
he retrieved the flag
as the morning spread upon the mountains
come to my room
it's all about myth making
guess what i'm talking about right now
if you can't go up
it's very clean
and things like that we'll do ourselves
it could be your passport to a small fortune
the appliances have been done nicely
on the second floor
this auction lot has it in spades
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
it won't take a moment
which is a shame
so what is the etiquette
this is a semifinal
i'll be popping in each evening
i'm getting older
cracks will appear
i love syllables
it's a long way from home
i'm still happy
lots of things to think about
this really is a tale of two cities
as you enter the rear part of the shop
i'm terribly sorry
he died that very first day
one was a pilot
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
but ten years ago
surrender was not an option
this is one of the questions
where i'm going
celebrating 100 years of war films
being on my own
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
because of the demand of the market
it's hard to come away from it
it might be viable
if you intend to bid on a place
sometimes it's difficult to know where
that's my kind of location
it seems a very good location
i don't remember that happening before
if you can have sex
maybe to somewhere nice and safe
don't forget that scarecrow
it's a baking show
she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
and then when it came to his signature
and it might seem ridiculous
in this universe
but when you open the box
staggering on the edge of space
neutrons and electrons
we live in a tiny
pondering the immensity
the forces of nature separate out
stretching back 3
12 miles in diameter
that's not right
it's often forgotten
he hoped to return to power
depended on trade
with that flourish
the very best talents
serbia is pandemonium let loose
which is absolutely understandable
would not be a happy place
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his powers
the most energetic people in
and he was very devoted to his children
my great great grandfather
what you need to do is get the very best brains
which was the mass newspaper
because the empire
and would eventually marry her after his wife
please donate now
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
for a brief time
the rochelle to my marvin
nicola is definitely the love of my life
i guess i'm afraid
that's what child support services does
she's my juliet
thanks for watching
represented by this bunch of bananas
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
it's down to our brain getting things wrong
but there was even better news
he was about to find out
and it is a service
i like spending time with him
but i'm not sure where
they haven't gone far
we need to start layering
time now for one of the greatest tv comebacks of our time
harold in neighbours
trying to bring them down over the centuries
we need to do something bigger
clearly they do
real friends that care about me
why don't we all object
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
that's good news
rather than using drugs
but these are one of the most wary birds in the world
in terms of fire service resources
the big question is
have you ordered yours yet
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the bronte sisters
that's not what i was expecting at all
no one would look twice
at the same time
i had no idea how much
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
now you listen to me
that's what i am
if it gives me some sort of control back
with strong winds
it's a wonderful
we might find some maritime memorabilia
maybe more of steel and iron
think about the melting sea ice
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
which melts more ice
once those lift doors open
and for that reason
i'm really sorry
just like my personality
i know it quite well
whatever they decide to call the company
i want to be in the holding company
to the potential investor
good luck to him and the elusive michael beckett in their new dragon partnership
that's according to the police watchdog
enjoy the money
we bought the firm back
embossed leather wallpaper
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
to be completely honest
and let's face it
although i can't imagine why
project management is really my specialist area
because i just want to help
he's my builder
we played in a band together
everywhere you go around here
they decided to tie the knot
it's time to return to wolverhampton
this is where the surprises happen
what do you think
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone digital
what season was that
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
we need to find out is there a problem
so it's an inspiration
and it's a strange
you don't need it
the president's chair
the reason being
not to think for themselves
we need to be a team
i can't take much more of this
i know how hard you work
and this is very important
a floating hotel
across 95 miles
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular sightings
if the answer is no
we don't have brown bear
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent ten years himself in exile
when you're away from it
the day to day lives of tenants
the job description of a farmer's wife
we were flabbergasted
it's a tremendous responsibility
remember that man with the camera
we had no money
i'm just saying that denise brought me up
i'm not having a go at you
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with your approval
when you came back
my little boy is
we had a blazing row
i don't care what the cost is
and in the process of me not offending god
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
but i couldn't believe it would be true
as opposed to chinese
if you've got a good story
it's all about rarity
and the man who made the discovery
it's just a wee village
the fishing villages on the northeast coast
some you have to book
later on in life
as is the title of this poem
fast and furious
he moved around a lot
and later in turn
there's always historical treasures to look at
so you should be
i'm not massively happy
did they get it done on time and for the right money
if it was going to be increased
a one bedroom first floor flat
but it's a decent size
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
if you are looking round auction properties before the auction
as you might say
please don't try to vote if you're watching on demand
so please welcome
tension and emotion
it was actually extremely well placed
and it's perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with the trophy
with white christmas
everyone on the show really
this could be a first class routine
so please welcome
even the foreplay
very expensive shed
without my sunglasses
someone came out of a neighbouring property and said
so from his vantage point
there is no air so there is no sound
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
the job was done
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the queen mary and the queen elizabeth
they were in the minority
its design values
500 tons of ocean liner
they kept living
been intensely sad
it was a brutal experience
in exact detail
and in the morning
many people did slip and fall and break a leg
set up by the government
and the second generation
and all the survivors of the holocaust
one bedroom apartments around here at the moment
realistic value wise
add another ten on
probably around 85
and since the conversion
for this property
but in this case
so i'll ask you again
you know most of it
people sat on the stairs
which is ideal for it
and that had an important effect
very attractive young woman
again open to the elements
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
provided by the railways
i'm sure you can imagine
if we have a little argument
going all over the world
that was amazing
just working with him every week is such a treat
go about telling him that
before you know it
let's say for example
if you go wrong
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
everywhere you turn
for good reasons and bad reasons
obsessed with this show
you go to bed with it
so when he gets grumpy it's like
if they start from here
if i had my way
she is hysterical
because they've got to
that's a pickled walnut
the longer you stay in
very high level
because you work so hard
which was quite amusing
people are happy to be there and it's a good vibe
when i was a kid
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
they have no idea what to expect
thanks for watching
two and a half minutes for that round
so let's get on with it
graham baron ash
and they were the first people
every year since christmas began
maybe not uranium
you can't really say
sausages in bacon
in victorian britain
it becomes a fire engine
on the orders of queen victoria
you see that present
already in the states
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
you do love your doll
you want to look
when i get home
stick some james bond on
like most other forms of modern warfare
i actually wanted to be a horse
but in those days
usually a bicycle
or is it that you enjoy those toys and it makes you into a different person
you unfold the board
space was still the final frontier
the right place
the ball shaped one
it looks really like it is
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
if you didn't have one
not in front of the whole family
that someone was going to get
so what he did to get round that
way back in the early
they were innocent and charming
what was all that about
i think he's perfect
when it comes to toys
at the same time
through the accessibility to those children
some burn brightly for a year or two
four little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
the prime minister slaps him down
that first meeting
they would be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just a hotel
but the waldorf astoria
are they relatives of yours
for some reason
i'm your simon cowell
i just can't seem to win
courage under fire
this is the lord ashcroft gallery
trapped under heavy artillery fire
most of his life
ten days beforehand
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other one
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
the following spring
over the last few weeks
face to really tell the story
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
get yourself over here because first up tonight
louise and kevin
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreography ever seen on the box
look at me at all
because i must say
garage and techno funk
end of november
don't you agree
great leonard cohen
only seven places remain
like many others
for me it doesn't make sense
so when the body is brought back
there are a lot of people
if we have a belief in reincarnation
non violent offences
even though her father at that time disagreed
my first granddaughter
the cost of this failure
but i come across training prisons now
talking about this
the average cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
around the world
all the information will be there
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
rescuing a damsel in distress
we still have all of this to come
but what exactly is it
everyone was blown away
i want to take a selfie
all of that could change
how does it work
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i couldn't read it
except as a last resort
i can't believe
where's the horns
we want to know what you think
there is so much on over the weekend
george skinner is with me
what's the best thing about the royal highland show
and on sunday at 12
that's the holy grail
if you build it
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
the main concern
but what a surprise when you come in
stick to what you're good at
but he did really well
that is important
it's not as easy as it looks
he's looking to sell it
what do you think about that
because it's fantastic
and you've got every right to be
came up with the perfect name
while we've been away
a very popular tourist destination
also very good for any strains
what do you think
ready to go racing
and the top end of 15 to 18
tell me about it
i just love that
they were friends
until next time
it was really nice
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
puerto rican style
you won't have long
it's an amazing place
but that's all changing
some members of the public don't quite understand leasehold
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
choosing a good location
i know it comes with planning permission
where is the gas
you never know by the end of the build
we've got a great relationship
would you want new neighbours every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learned some really important property lessons
if you lived in the building
just before christmas
i think she's completely bonkers
that's it for the reds
it'll be a brilliant success
i'm not satisfied
i went to use my right arm
and it was totally normal
but at the same time
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
if i didn't have her
all my fingers were hanging off
he was shot and killed
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
and with that in mind
it's time to find out if nigel
not just here in nottinghamshire
but it seems the pendant is to everyone's personal taste
his father died
that is a first
i can plant them in that spot
that's quite a large leaf
and the reason for that
a little saxifrage
it may be a miniature compared to that
and it's a great way to eat it
wherever you are
eight feet tall
i think it looks great
sometimes it doesn't
i don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
but it might be too late by then
for the most part
i can't put it any plainer than that
which is relatively small by scottish standards
the price of property
on the other hand
not just in this town
anywhere in the world
i just collapsed
demonstrates the value of green space
so ten cubic metres
we have all the usual suspects
thanks for watching
i wouldn't say i'm a star
manchester united fans
it'll mean more matches
and more money for fifa
the family seat
when he retired
visiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
even before she entered the water
she was a flawed ship
is it true she was
i don't mind this one
and i do mean hundreds
while i'm surrounded by water right now
and i suppose the bottom line is if you want a thriving
we knew nothing about making cheese
so at one point
i think it will
very happy indeed
when the archaeologists got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away
this really makes us think
maybe there's an extensive pattern
which is incredible
also known as a tandem
but my goodness
which explains it
how can i do that
what was it that made you think
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
purely by chance
destroying the property
if you haven't caught it yet
herself currently learning to sign
in the meantime
if you're watching
some people here tonight prefer subtitles
hasn't time flown
surely as a matter of principle
standard rates apply
you think i did this
i made a few calls
you're an idiot
she informed me
before we go any further
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
with family and friends
men want to be him
it's all about the strictly pro challenge
and as a result
the man takes the lead
it was incredible entertainment
that was amazing
up until last week
it's time now for everything in between
it was an incredible performance
how big is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
so wonderful to see that
why show me this
the wonderful discovery of witches
while we make our way down the coastline
and our experts
we need some antiques
don't you think
you've had a tough day
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
we worked together when we were starting out
the perfect pint
without further ado
thanks for watching
so let's find out who that will be
some decent scores
could we arrange that
all life in the arctic
now they are gathering
i was fine yesterday
that's a shocking percentage
children and adults alike
and yet that and fish and chips
you should never be put off
there are times i like to listen to bananarama
i'm not sure what's the most difficult thing to get right
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify wrongs
gardens never finish
where are the maldives
and i really hope
no food left out
i'll meet you at the party
in the eyes of some
awaiting court martial
rommel was falling back
it could end tonight
make sure you never get depressed again
you need to be strong up here
with billy not being yours
but she's not confused
causes it no harm
it's that simple
but now we have these viruses
but not for me as a farmer
squirrel pox virus
no more suicide bombers
i'd like to help you
i don't want to resign
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
you don't have to be a celebrity
proper street food is great
very few remain
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
and the champagne
the time before him was his own
she is married now
best and happiest of all
not well dressed
what else can i be
there is one thing
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
furniture or objects like that
it was made in germany
that's what you said
so i don't know
it's just a name
every week he comes out
the rivalry and all that
how great is this
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
they are battling to be crowned pro challenge champion
but despite all this
25 years to complete
if you want to experience some of that
but despite all this
they carried on competing
she will be very pleased
one male official commented
because there was no role model
with corrupt governments
something like that
because of the small size
she's got the best top line in the business
we talked about it
right in front of me
i honestly don't know what to do
we are the criminals
we have no more money
please welcome jenny eclair
it's a movie theme
you can get a better structure
the garden of england
then we must rescue her
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
and on this fateful evening
and with stealth
before we begin
keep going on about this
learn as much as possible
mr khan speaking
a tribal nation
why don't we all just get along
rising above it
i wish i was more like you
the olympic swimmer
if we have learned one thing over the past year
i don't really want to go
between them now
i have had my fitting now
a place which is hard to live
there's more woodland
here's some ideas
so when the farmers come
and the farmers opening it up
don't tell anyone
we would love to sell it
if you've got it
we would love to see you
by some miracle
these laws would remain in place for over 200 years
the ringleader of the gunpowder plot
as a result of the gunpowder plot
the way the market is
all hoping the king would fall
i think it's brilliant
i really appreciate it
we know what they are
searching for answers
protected from the prevailing winds
but since jack's first discovery
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
and then of course
just like any good comic book villain
after just a couple of days
there's no obvious reason
regardless of what happens
we both want to be here
he still wanted
doesn't mean to say that we get on with everybody
i really miss the island
and it's a beautiful place as well
from time to time
it can be quite daunting
a revolution is taking place
for whatever reason
over the next few weeks
thanks for watching
it's not a career
the best bargains
it's a plus point
not quite as high
the first and second floor flats
on the face of it
who knew that one man
and it's not just any old tuesday
and it may well be
this is my revenge
and he'd be like
you're all the same
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
is in the drying
thanks for watching
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
but now there's more protection
about 20 years ago
taking horticulture to the extreme
and a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
this whole area will still be in safe hands
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
some 200 years later
thanks for watching
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
but i felt he was exposed
then the invitation
and more open to the parliament
they say that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
part two is the declaration of rights
to divide the room into two parts
it makes them sound like an action film
it was the battle of the boyne
which of course
he was halfway there
there was a glimmer of hope
more open minded perhaps
i love this name
the shot of musket
it is the quarter finals
judging by what i saw today
just between you and me
i need to get to work
before i announce the winner
a new chance at life
i don't really mind
they get lost on the way home
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
any man would be proud to have you as a son
at the end of the day
born into a family of dancers
he's a latin sensation
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
in the basement
things like this became very
good luck with that
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right now
and that's what it's all about
we found out about the suffolk punch horses
join us next time for many more surprises
the quality of that sliding across
you should think about it
a rather special
twice during the first world war
in this country
right on the front
she never let on
i expected you to have a past
instead of being someone's arm candy
it's still going up
with the price of gold
i would say probably about 25
and this wasn't unusual
to have no contact at all
we heard the story of the nurse anna cross
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forces do without question
back in sierra leone
i think you deserve
we've got 24 characters
how do i choose this
a striking contrast
following those words
and we run love
and you and him
will appear in court next month
finding the right path is not always easy
i just got back
that's all for this week
if you're watching
i'm not jeremy vine
and what a privilege that is
standing in for your regular host for one week only
very similar to fishing
and i feel very
through antibody directed therapy
so in the meantime
in the highway code itself
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
before i came out
islam allows polygamy
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly known as simon
there is a huge crossover between the two
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing propaganda
i feel like this
or more correctly councils
because that's how you are a part of society
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us then
there was a stone circle here
